**How to use effectively:**

1. Use QR code to login to whatsapp. Go to Whatsapp app on your phone > Settings > Linked devices > Link device. Note that Whatsapp only allows you to be linked with 4 devices, please remove additonal devices if unable to login.
2. Once logged in, **please keep your phone open on Whatsapp** to allow photos to sync and be downloaded.
3. It takes around 3 minutes for 50 photos. So please allow up to 10 minutes for the program to finish, the program will let you know once it is finished.
4. To view the downloaded photos, please view the folder on the desktop "Silvan Dog Dayz Photos", then choose desired date, then desired dog.
5. If there are multiple dogs with the same name, for example "Lucy", all Lucy's will appear in the folder "Lucy". Duplicates are numbered to prevent confusion.
6. This program is not perfect and may have errors. Simply restart the program and try again.

Note, if there are photos that are low resolution or for whatever reason unusable (typically the photos that have been taken by android phones have the problems), you will have to manually locate the photo within the chat. This is an issue with whatsapp and something that I cannot overcome but at least this will give you an idea of the photo and whether you wnat to pursure it or not.

Final note, **remember** to keep your phone open on the Whatsapp app whilst it is working!
