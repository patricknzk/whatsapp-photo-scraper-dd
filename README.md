**Dog Dayz Silvan Photo Scraper**

Author: Patrick Naumczyk

**Background information:** 

**The issue:** Manually searching through photos of dogs uploaded by staff in a whatsapp groupchat. Correctly identifying relevant images then saving them all while seeing only 2-3 photos at a time (limitation due to whatsapp user interface). Clients rely on seeing their dogs happy and healthy which is shown and supported by the photos taken by staff. Quickly sorting these images allow for more time spent on more important things, such as planning the next day/week. 

**My Solution:** Automatic web scraper which downloads all uploaded photos of the current day, saved onto your desktop, sorted by date, and name of the dog in image.

**Progress**
- 90% Complete.
- Require an executable to be run a desktop that does not require python.
- Key instructions on how to use the script.
